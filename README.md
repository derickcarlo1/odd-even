# Python Program to Extract Even and Odd Numbers from a Text File
This program reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. The program creates two other text files: even.txt that contains all even numbers extracted from numbers.txt, and odd.txt that contains all odd numbers extracted from numbers.txt.

# Programming Language Used
Python

# For installation
No installation is required. Simply download the numbers.txt file and the extract_numbers.py file to the same directory on your machine.

# Running the Program
You can run the program in two ways:

# Using Visual Studio Code
1. Open the extract_numbers.py file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal window in Visual Studio Code.
3. Type the following command in the terminal window to run the program:
python extract_numbers.py

# Using an IDE or Command Prompt
1. Open the command prompt or IDE on your machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the extract_numbers.py file and the numbers.txt file.
3. Type the following command to run the program:
python extract_numbers.py

# Output
After running the program, you will find two new files in the same directory: even.txt and odd.txt. These files contain the even and odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt file.

# About Me
The Python program I created reads a text file named "numbers.txt" containing 20 integers. It then extracts all the even numbers from the file and saves them in a new text file named "even.txt". Similarly, it extracts all the odd numbers and saves them in a new text file named "odd.txt".
I created this program to demonstrate my ability to read and write to files in Python, as well as my understanding of basic control structures like loops and if statements. This program can be useful in situations where a user needs to quickly separate even and odd numbers from a large set of data.
To run this program in Visual Studio Code or any other Python IDE, simply save the code to a Python file with a ".py" extension and run the file. Make sure that the "numbers.txt" file is in the same directory as the Python file. The program will create two new files, "even.txt" and "odd.txt", in the same directory.
